## 1. Overview
In this section provides a brief overview of the business problem.  By brief, it should include a single image (business process or use case diagram) and a textual explanation (describing actors, tasks, information, or outcomes) and described in *Step 4*.

**Business Overview**: Students, staff, and guests can access the online dining service, The Falcon, through connection of the Messiah Network. Being able to process payments via online allows for people to be more efficient throughout their day. Having food delivered is an additional way The Falcon is willing to help students. The site will allow users to be able to send orders online and be able to be notified when the food has been delivered. The payments and orders are processed by The Falcon through the site user login information through the network.
