## 1. Overview

**Business Problem**: “I would like to order a meal from an on-campus provider, and have it delivered to my classroom.”

#### Business Problem Explanation
In this business example, the client first orders the food and pays for it via the online system. Then, the system immediately processes the order and returns the estimated delivery time to the client. The employee and chef then simultaneously receive the processed order so that the chef can cook the food and the employee can package it. The delivery staff then receives the location of the client and the packaged food and delivers it.

## 2. Requirements
### Business requirements
  - Business must experience an increase in sales and profit (Ed Holthause)
  - Customer orders must be easily accessible to all employees involved in completing the order (Forward Thinker #1)
  - Orders must be limited based on inventory (Daniel)
  - Business must have enough staff for the execution of this service (Ed)
### User Requirements
- The user must have a simple payment method (Ed)
- Interface must be set up properly (Ed)
- User must have approval by professor (Ed)
- Order will be accurate when delivered (Daniel)

### Functional Requirements
- Order processes must be simple (Daniel)
- All Messiah students and employees will be able to access service (Daniel)
- There must not be an over abundance of choices - As Steve Jobs says, "We're going to tell you what you want and you're gonna love it." (Ed)

### Non-functional Requirements
- Users must not have access to or the ability to edit the order queue for security reasons (Ed)
- An item must be selected before completion of order (Daniel)
- Service will be accessible on mobile device as well as laptop or PC (Ed)
- Order process will load quickly (Impatient Student #1)
- Performance will not be affected by large volume of people (Ed)

### System Requirements
- Must be updated hourly (Daniel)
- Confirmation of order will be given after completion (Expectant Student #1)
- Delivery time must be estimated by system (Expectant Student #2)
- Location access must be enabled and client's device must give that authority (Ed)
## 3. Assumptions
 
It is assumed that there will be enough staff for an employee, other than a chef and delivery man, to package the order and get it ready for delivery. This is shown in the business process model in Section 1 above.
